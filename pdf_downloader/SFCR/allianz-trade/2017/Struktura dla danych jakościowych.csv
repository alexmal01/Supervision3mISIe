2;35;;E.4.3.;"E.4.3.EH Ré SA has implemented a data quality framework across the whole company in accordance with the Solvency II expectations. Thus, EH Ré SA has produced all necessary deliverables with roles and responsibilities for each of them adding to an overall data governance organization. Hence, the EH Ré SA data quality framework has set in place specific committees at different levels (the Group Data Quality Council at strategic level and the Data Committee at operational level) and a clear definition of the stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities with validated attributions. Moreover, in order to monitor the quality of data, KPIs have been implemented, are monitored and reported to the various committees through data quality dashboards. This consolidation and report-ing towards data committees are executed in such a way to be aligned to the EH quarterly RC closing process. These KPIs are reported separately: KPIs per risk type on one side and IT KPIs on the other side. In 2017, the number of the KPIs has materially increased compared to the last exercise. It is now con-sidered that the data quality for captives should include the TCI KPIs from the BUs that are ceding to the corresponding captive. These “indirect” KPIs are labelled as part of the Credit Insurance Risk. EH Ré SA 2017 Solvency and Financial Condition Report page 103 of 107 Hereunder is a Data Quality Dashboard as of Q4 2017 showing that the quality of the data used at EH Ré SA to calculate the RC is totally under control ; no direct KPIs at EH Ré SA level are assessed as not effective yet (“KO”). 23 indirect KPIs are identified as “KO” but their number compared to the total of KPIs is deemed non-material.";01.01.1970;1;1;85;101

21;27;;D.2.6.;D.2.6.In accordance with the technical guidance provided by EIOPA and Allianz, the discount effect is cur-rently calculated by taking into account the volatility adjustment (VA) inside the risk-free SWAP (yield) curves. We have performed a sensitivity study where we have applied only the EUR SWAP curve with and without volatility adjustment to the cashflows, i.e. omitting the impact of different settlement currencies.

26;27;;D.2.1 D.2.1.1.;value of the technical provisions corresponds to the current amount required to transfer all in-surance obligations immediately to another insurance entity. Technical provisions consists of the claims provision, premium provision and risk margin, together they constitute the best estimate lia-bilities (BEL). BELs are defined as the weighted average of future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money (the present value of future cash flows), determined from the relevant risk-free interest rate curve published by EIOPA, with the application of the correction for volatility (risk free). Due to the time required to dispose of the curve published by EIOPA, the Allianz Group derives the discount interest rate curve, which may differ slightly from that published by EIOPA. The best estimate is calculated gross, without deduction of claims arising from reinsurance contracts. Gross and Ceded amounts are calculated separately. The projected cash flows used in the calculation of the BELs include all the cash inflows and outflows required to meet the insurance and reinsurance obligations in the existing portfolio (or run-off) whose projection horizon must cover the whole life. The ceded Best-Estimate liabilities are estimated by netting the gross Best-Estimate liabilities. The ceded Best-Estimate liabilities are adjusted by the Counterparty Default Adjustment (CDA).;01.01.1970;1;1;85;101

30;26;;D.1.4.;D.1.4.The default valuation method for assets and liabilities (other than TP) under Solvency II is the use of quoted market prices in active markets for the same assets or liabilities. The use of quoted market prices is based on the criteria for active markets as defined in IFRS. EH Ré SA 2017 Solvency and Financial Condition Report page 78 of 107 Where the criteria for active markets are not satisfied, EH Ré SA uses alternative valuation methods. When using alternative valuation methods, EH Ré SA relies as little as possible on entity-specific in-puts and makes maximum use of relevant market inputs. If relevant observable inputs are not availa-ble, EH Ré SA uses unobservable inputs reflecting the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. The valuation technique used is consistent with one or more of the following approaches: ;01.01.1970;1;1;85;101

40;21;;C.4.7.;C.4.7.EH Ré SA identified several liquidity stress scenarios and chose to perform the one which appeared to be the most relevant for 2017: a deterioration of the market conditions leading to an economic crisis, a recession event which implies an increase of the claim frequency for credit insurers. Thus, a combination of a market stress scenario and a recession scenario (Reserve Risk and Credit Risk) was simulated. After application of the countermeasures, the liquidity ratio calculated in Q4 2017 for different 2018 time horizons remains under 100% but does not fall under the 80% threshold, even under these stressed conditions.

45;21;;C.4.2.;C.4.2.The Liquidity Risk management framework is built on a regular Liquidity Risk assessment and supervi-sion, made by regular monitoring of liquidity positions. To this end, EH Ré SA monitors quarterly the market values of its assets and their classification in terms of liquidity. This monitoring especially aims at gauging the liquid assets that EH Ré SA could sell in a short period of time in case the liquidity ratio raises over 100%. Such asset sales are part of the “countermeas-ures” considered in the quarterly liquidity analysis. The following table shows that, as of Q4 2017, only 28% of EH Ré SA’s assets are illiquid while 72% are in the liquidity buffer.;01.01.1970;1;1;85;101

52;19;;C.2.7.;C.2.7.EH Ré SA has designed and implemented a firm-wide program covering stress testing and scenario analysis. For stress tests, EH Ré SA usually follows standard shocks in line with European Insurance and Occu-pational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) recommendations. For scenario analysis , a dedicated process is run by the Enterprise Stress Testing Group which is a panel made of risk, business and economic ex-perts who meet on an annual basis to identify up to 5 most relevant stress scenarios for the year to come. These scenarios are subsequently proposed to EH RiCo for review and selection before execu-tion across EH Ré SA. It must be noted that the scenarios described in the following sections are enterprise-wide scenarios and not specifically designed for EH Ré SA on a standalone basis. As a result, the assumptions listed are those directly applied to insurance entities ceding to EH Ré SA. Non-market assumptions indirect-ly affect EH Ré SA through the cession from EH insurance entities while market assumptions directly impact EH Ré SA risk profile. All tests and scenarios are further detailed in the following sections.;01.01.1970;1;1;85;101

54;19;;C.2.5.;"C.2.5.Market Risk mitigation is performed by applying investment strategies to mitigate high volatility as-sets as well as a regular monitoring of the investments. These strategies are applied through the quantitative financial limits which are one of the components of the Risk Appetite defined in the Risk Strategy. They include different kinds of limits; the following table summarizes the level of the sensi-tivity limits in place:";01.01.1970;1;1;85;101

56;19;;C.2.3.;C.2.3.EH Ré SA actively manages its investment portfolio and is actively taking investment risks in a con-trolled and limited manner. This is based on the firm belief that by taking risks on the investment side additional value can be generated on a mid to long-term basis, i.e. that the additional return on in-vestments overcompensates the additional cost of capital in the mid- to long-run. This approach results in a mid to long-term focused investment policy with an emphasis on SAA and the goal of realizing the long-term risk premium of asset classes. EH Ré SA 2017 Solvency and Financial Condition Report page 58 of 107 Tactical asset allocation is used on a limited basis as an enhancement to the SAA in order to profit from market opportunities. The investment activities follow the general principles of a congruent ALM with a sufficient duration and currency matching within prescribed limits. All technical reserves are supported by investments made by ITG in respect with local regulation.
